Okay, let's summarize the key learnings from our process of disabling Firefox's Private Browsing UI and functionality:

1.  **Multiple Layers of Control:** Firefox features often have controls at different levels:
    *   **Preferences (`about:config`):** Control the core backend behavior (e.g., `browser.privatebrowsing.enabled`). Setting these is often the first step but usually doesn't affect the UI visibility directly. These can be set manually, via `policies.json`, or via Autoconfig (`firefox.cfg`).
    *   **Policies (`policies.json`):** A more enterprise-focused way to lock down preferences and some features. Less flexible for fine-grained UI changes compared to Autoconfig.
    *   **UI Elements (XUL/HTML/CSS):** The visual components (menus, buttons, keyboard shortcuts defined in the browser's chrome). These often need separate manipulation.
    *   **Commands (`<command>` elements):** Underlying actions often triggered by menus or shortcuts. Disabling the command can be more effective than just hiding the trigger elements.

2.  **Autoconfig (`firefox.cfg` + `local-settings.js`) is Powerful for UI/JS Mods:** For modifications requiring JavaScript (like finding and hiding/disabling UI elements dynamically), the Autoconfig mechanism is the most flexible built-in method.
    *   Requires `local-settings.js` in `defaults/pref` to enable `firefox.cfg`.
    *   Requires `firefox.cfg` in the main Resources directory containing the JavaScript code (must start with a comment line).

3.  **Targeting the Right Window/Document is Crucial:** Autoconfig scripts can run in multiple contexts (main browser window, hidden windows, devtools, etc.).
    *   Use an observer like `chrome-document-global-created` to trigger code when windows load.
    *   Inside the handler, **check the `document.documentURI`** to ensure your code only runs on the intended target (e.g., `chrome://browser/content/browser.xhtml` for the main browser UI).

4.  **Timing Matters (`DOMContentLoaded` + `setTimeout`):** You cannot manipulate UI elements before they exist in the DOM.
    *   Listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event on the target window/document.
    *   Even after `DOMContentLoaded`, complex UI elements might not be *fully* initialized. Using **`window.setTimeout`** (with a short delay like 500-1000ms) inside the `DOMContentLoaded` handler provides a robust way to wait for elements to become available.
    *   Remember to get the correct `window` object (`document.defaultView`) to call `setTimeout` on (`window.setTimeout`).

5.  **Finding the Correct Element IDs is Key (and can change):**
    *   Browser UI element IDs (`#menu_newPrivateWindow`, `#Tools:PrivateBrowsing`, etc.) can change between Firefox versions.
    *   **Debugging Tool:** Use the **Browser Toolbox** (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I or Cmd+Shift+Option+I -> Settings cog -> Enable Browser Chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes -> Ok -> Tools -> Browser Tools -> Browser Toolbox) to inspect the browser's own UI and find current element IDs.
    *   **Source Code:** Looking at Firefox source files (like `browser-sets.inc` we used) can reveal the canonical IDs for commands and keys.

6.  **Disabling Commands vs. Hiding Elements:**
    *   **Hiding (`element.hidden = true` / `setAttribute('hidden', 'true')`)**: Removes the element visually. Good for simple menu items or elements without complex interactions. Hiding a `<key>` element might *not* disable the shortcut action itself.
    *   **Disabling (`element.setAttribute('disabled', 'true')`)**: Makes the element non-interactive. Crucially, disabling a `<command>` element (e.g., `Tools:PrivateBrowsing`) often disables *all* associated triggers (menus, shortcuts) and visually greys out linked menu items. This is often the preferred method for neutralizing functionality tied to a command.

7.  **Debugging is Essential:** Use `Cu.reportError("Your message here")` within your `firefox.cfg` script. View the output in the **Browser Console** (Tools -> Browser Tools -> Browser Console) to track execution flow, see errors (like `setTimeout` scope issues, elements not found), and verify steps.

In essence, customizing Firefox often involves understanding its layered structure, using Autoconfig for dynamic JS changes, carefully targeting the right context and timing, finding the correct element IDs (which might require debugging tools), and choosing the right method (disabling commands vs. hiding elements) for the desired effect.
